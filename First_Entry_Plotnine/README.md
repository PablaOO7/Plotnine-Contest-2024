## 🚀 About This Entry
Welcome to my first-ever plotnine contest entry! This project is a journey into the artistic possibilities of data visualization using the powerful plotnine library. It features two unique visualizations:

1. **🎮 Ready Player P9: The Tetris Challenge**
A Tetris-inspired masterpiece that turns data into a playful, nostalgic game board.
2. **🌈 The Secret Life of P9: A Colorful Adventure**
An abstract heatmap that transforms data points into a vibrant, annotated tapestry.
